Always there when I needed him. He always had the back of the kenzo community. His contributions to the the android community are uncountable. He always helped me whenever I asked him to. I always felt great whenever he complimented me about my work or what I did. We used to talk a lot but he never disclosed about his personal life & family. He had a great knowledge about what he did. He knew almost everything I ever asked about. Words can't describe my feelings. I am very saddened by this news and my heart is heavy. Everything is feeling worthless. I don't want to contribute anymore. I can't explain anymore. I am feeling restless. I wish I asked more about him & knew more about his life. Because he did so many things for us, I want to know more about him, his family. Rest in peace brother. - Amol Amrit
